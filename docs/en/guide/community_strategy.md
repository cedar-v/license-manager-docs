# Community Development Strategy

## 1. Vision & Mission

We are committed to making **License Manager** the industry-standard infrastructure for software licensing management. Our mission is to lower the barriers to software distribution and copyright protection through open source, while ensuring enterprise-grade security and reliability.

We believe that reliable infrastructure software must withstand extensive community validation and requires long-term investment from a professional team.

## 2. Development Philosophy: Core-Led, Community-Driven

To ensure project sustainability and technical architecture rigor, we adopt a **"Core-Led, Community-Driven"** governance model:

* **Core Team**: Acts as the project's "gatekeepers," responsible for setting the technical roadmap, controlling architectural design, reviewing core code, and maintaining system security. We commit to keeping core functionality open source and neutral.
* **Community Contributors**: Serve as the project's "radar" and "accelerator." We rely on the community to discover real-world pain points, report bugs, contribute multi-language SDKs, improve documentation, and share best practices.

## 3. Sustainable Development Model

Open source is not a whim, but a marathon. To ensure License Manager can be maintained long-term, we have established a transparent sustainable development mechanism:

### 3.1 Symbiosis of Business and Open Source

We do not shy away from commercialization, as healthy commercial revenue is the fuel for continuous iteration of open source projects. We achieve this through:

* **Feedback Mechanism**: General features, performance optimizations, and security patches accumulated in commercial projects will be prioritized for merging back into the open source main branch.
* **Enterprise Support**: By providing value-added services to enterprise users, we use the funds for full-time developer salaries, server infrastructure, and community activity operations.

### 3.2 Ecosystem Collaboration

We encourage and actively seek deep collaboration with community developers and enterprise users. Whether through integration plugins, developing client SDKs for specific languages, or building industry solutions based on this platform, we view all as part of ecosystem prosperity.

## 4. Roadmap Planning Mechanism

We will regularly (quarterly) publicly update the Roadmap.

* **Requirement Collection**: All requirements from Issues and Discussions will enter the requirement pool.
* **Priority Assessment**: The core team will evaluate requirements based on three dimensions: "Generality," "Security," and "Urgency."
* **Transparent Decision-Making**: For major architectural changes or feature deprecations, we will solicit community input through the RFC (Request for Comments) process.

## 5. Your Participation

We need not just code, but also your voice. You can participate in License Manager's future through:

* **Feedback on Scenarios**: Tell us what scenarios you use it in and what obstacles you encounter.
* **Improve Documentation**: Help us make obscure technical details more accessible.
* **Promotion and Evangelism**: Let more developers know about and use this tool.

Every line of code, every Issue, and every discussion will be taken seriously.
