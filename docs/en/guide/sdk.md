# Client SDK

The client SDK packages the license parsing, signature verification, and runtime health checks that every edge/desktop/embedded client needs so you don’t have to re-implement the security workflow in multiple codebases.

## Quick Links

- GitHub repository (README + samples + API docs): [https://github.com/cedar-v/license-manager-sdk-go](https://github.com/cedar-v/license-manager-sdk-go)
- License structure reference: [`/en/guide/license-token-structure`](/en/guide/license-token-structure)

> All hands-on content (installation, configuration, examples, changelog) lives inside the repository README so there is only one source of truth.

## When to Use

- Boot-time validation on standalone or edge deployments
- Hybrid setups that exchange heartbeats with the License Manager service
- Clients that need consistent error codes and logging for license enforcement
